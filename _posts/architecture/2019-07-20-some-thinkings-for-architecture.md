These are a list of architecture related ideas. Audience is not limited to dev, but all kinds of technology related people.

- `KISS` Keep it simple stupid. Anytime, when you are working on a feature, design, coding etc. Make sure make it as simple as possible. 
- `Crawl, Walk, Run`. Make it work, make it fine, make it great.
- `Shared Nothing Architecture`
