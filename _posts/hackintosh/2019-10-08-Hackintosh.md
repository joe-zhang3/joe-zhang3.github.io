> OpenCore with AMD hackintosh

Need to follow [this](https://khronokernel-2.gitbook.io/opencore-vanilla-desktop-guide/) link step by step. I only put down those problems I met.

### Make a USB stick

Stongly recommend you to use the native macOS way to make the USB installer disk, that is find the os you want to install and download it to your macintosh. Execute the `CreateInstallMedia` command to create the USB.

### Prepare files. 

1. Download the laste `OpenCore` from [this](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg)
