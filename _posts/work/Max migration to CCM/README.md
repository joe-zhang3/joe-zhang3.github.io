# MaxG migration to CCM (Phase 1)

> This is a collection proposal reagding the migration between MaxG & CCM.

*Phase 1 will only focuse on agency, customer, activity part*

One thing to be noted is that, I list out what currently MaxG has but does not mean it is necessary. Because of some historical reasons, some fields/properties are not used anymore, but we don't have enough room to filter them out. Also, some fields/properties are not designed well, if CCM has better solutions, then it is fine.

Two main problems need to be addressed are:

1. Multiple locations in MaxG, however CCM does not have the concent of a location.
2. Cross season registrations. CCM has the feature that the shopping cart will restrict items in the shopping cart to under one season.
